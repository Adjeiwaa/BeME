Project kick off
Here are some things to consider while deciding on your final week project:

Your product
    •   What are you going to make? - A task management system with in built forum

    •   What problem does this solve? Being able to ask questions in real time without having to wait till the next morning. Being able to track your progress by comparing notes

    •   Who are you making it for? Participants of the Global Code camp

    •   What technologies / programming languages are you going to use? Bootstrap, Jquery, HTML, CSS, Django, Sqlite, MQTT(messaging/comments/replies)

Your planning
    •   How are you going to divide up the work? Bernard - BackEnd, Emerald - FrontEnd, Miriam - Research, Planning.

    •   How are you going to plan your time? we are going to research on technologies during the day and actively code during the night. This is because most of the teammates work better at night.

    •   How are you going to keep track of your progress? We will track our progress using Whatsapp and code and progress reviews during the day.

    •   How are you going to support your team mates? Each team member has some knowledge about the technologies being used. And as much as each person have their allocated tasks, we work on them together and help answer and research when there is any problems.

    •   What might you need to research? We might need to research into sqlite and how to integrate MQTT into our project.

    •   What other help might you need?
